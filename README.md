A device which is small and compact and allows you to monitor the power consumed by electrical appliances.
It also can switch on and off your connected electrical appliances remotly using an app.

# Components
- ESP8266
- AC Voltage Sensor Module ZMPT101B
- SCT013â€‘030 30A Current Sensor Clamp Current Transformation for Current Measurement
- Relay
